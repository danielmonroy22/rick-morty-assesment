üì° How the API Works
This app uses the Rick and Morty GraphQL API, which allows you to:

Fetch characters with filters (by name, status, species)

Get character details including image, location, species, and origin

Example GraphQL query used:

graphql
1. 
- this query is used to retrieve the charcaters from the api in page 1
query {
    characters(page: 1) {
      results {
        id
        name
        species
        image
      }
    }
  }
2. 
- this query is used to get the charcater by the name whe using the search input  
 query GetCharacter($name: String!) {
    characters(filter: { name: $name }) {
      results {
        id
        name
        species
        image
      }
    }
  }
3. 
- this query is used to retrieve character data based on the id

  export const GET_CHARACTER_BY_ID = gql`
  query GetCharacter($id: ID!) {
    character(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      status
      species
      type
      gender
      image
      origin {
        name
      }
      location {
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;


### Development Notes
